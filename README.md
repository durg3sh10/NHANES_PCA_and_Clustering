# NHANES_PCA_and_Clustering

We will take the NHANES dataset to understand how we analyze high-dimensional data. This dataset has nearly 200 features and we will put in action PCA and some clustering techniques to visualize insights from the dataset.

About the dataset
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations.The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year.

The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.

We will take this dataset to understand how we analyze high-dimensional data. This dataset has nearly 200 features and we will put in action PCA and some clustering techniques to visualize insights from the dataset.

First 3 PCA components:

We will be working with the following datasets:

Examinations dataset.

The examination dataset contains variables that measure the following parameters: - Blood pressure - Body measures - Muscle strength - grip test - Oral health - dentition - Taste & smell A complete variable dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Examination&CycleBeginYear=2013).
Dietary dataset.

The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary intake information from NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview (midnight to midnight), and to estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those foods and beverages. A complete variable dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Dietary&CycleBeginYear=2013).
Laboratory dataset.

The laboratory dataset contains variables that measure the following parameters: - Albumin & Creatinine - Urine - Apolipoprotein B - Blood Lead, Cadmium, Total Mercury, Selenium, and Manganese - Blood mercury: inorganic, ethyl and methyl - Cholesterol - HDL - Cholesterol - LDL & Triglycerides - Cholesterol - Total - Complete Blood Count with 5-part Differential - Whole Blood - Copper, Selenium & Zinc - Serum - Fasting Questionnaire - Fluoride - Plasma - Fluoride - Water - Glycohemoglobin - Hepatitis A - Hepatitis B Surface Antibody - Hepatitis B: core antibody, surface antigen, and Hepatitis D antibody - Hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA) and Hepatitis C Genotype - Hepatitis E: IgG & IgM Antibodies - Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 & Type-2 - HIV Antibody Test - Human Papillomavirus (HPV) - Oral Rinse - Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA - Vaginal Swab: Roche Cobas & Roche Linear Array - Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA Results from Penile Swab Samples: Roche Linear Array - Insulin - Iodine - Urine - Perchlorate, Nitrate & Thiocyanate - Urine - Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (formerly Polyfluoroalkyl Chemicals - PFC) - Personal Care and Consumer Product Chemicals and Metabolites - Phthalates and Plasticizers Metabolites - Urine - Plasma Fasting Glucose - Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) - Urine - Standard Biochemistry Profile - Tissue Transglutaminase Assay (IgA-TTG) & IgA Endomyseal Antibody Assay (IgA EMA) - Trichomonas - Urine - Two-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test - Urinary Chlamydia - Urinary Mercury - Urinary Speciated Arsenics - Urinary Total Arsenic - Urine Flow Rate - Urine Metals - Urine Pregnancy Test - Vitamin B12 A complete data dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Laboratory&CycleBeginYear=2013).
